<h3>Engine Mount Backplate Structural Analysis</h3>
<p>
Structural finite element pre-processing of a small four-stroke engine mounting backplate,
including geometry reduction, material assignment, localized mesh refinement at bolt holes
and bearing interfaces, and application of representative static loads and constraints.
</p>
<p class="status-note">
Note: Model setup is complete; solution execution was limited by ANSYS Student license
element restrictions.

<h3>SOLIDWORKS Certification & Design Practice</h3>
<p>
CSWA-certified parametric part and assembly modeling demonstrating robust design intent,
fully constrained sketches, clean feature trees, and predictable rebuild behavior.
Includes representative assemblies completed during structured certification preparation.
</p>
<p class="status-note">
Status: CSWA completed (240 / 240). CSWP preparation in progress.

<h3>Formula SAE Chassis Structural Analysis</h3>
<p>
Structural analysis of a Formula SAE tubular spaceframe chassis completed through ANSYS
Innovation Space. The project focused on line-body modeling, tube property assignment,
and evaluation under torsional stiffness, cornering, combined aerodynamic loading,
and frontal impact load cases.

<h3>Baja SAE Roll Cage Structural Analysis</h3>
<p>
Finite element analysis of a Baja SAE roll cage structure considering front, side, rear,
rollover, and torsional loading scenarios. Emphasis was placed on structural load paths,
driver safety, and interpretation of deformation and stress results under impact-like conditions.

<h3>Madison Aerospace Club – Rocket Design & Simulation</h3>
<p>
Preliminary rocket design and performance simulation using OpenRocket, including trade
studies on fin geometry, mass distribution, body length, and motor selection to evaluate
apogee, stability, and descent behavior in support of upcoming fabrication and flight testing.
