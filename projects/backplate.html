<h1>Engine Mount Backplate – Structural Analysis</h1>

<p><em>Status: Pre-processing complete. Solution limited by student license constraints.</em></p>

<hr>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>
This project investigates the structural behavior of a small 4-stroke internal combustion engine
mounting backplate under representative operational loads.
The objective is to evaluate stress concentrations, load paths, and mounting integrity
using finite element methods.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Tools:</strong> Fusion 360, ANSYS Mechanical (2025 R2 Student)
</p>

<h2>System Context & Geometry</h2>

<p>
The backplate is part of a 30&nbsp;cc model engine assembly. To establish realistic loading
context, the component was first evaluated within the full engine geometry before being
reduced to a standalone part for analysis.

<h2>Meshing Strategy</h2>

<p>
A tetrahedral solid mesh was generated with targeted refinement at stress-critical features,
including bearing bores, fastener holes, counterbores, and outer fillets. Local sizing controls
were applied to capture stress gradients while maintaining a reasonable global element count.

Final mesh statistics:
<ul>
  <li>~75,000 nodes</li>
  <li>~40,000 elements</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Loads & Boundary Conditions</h2>

<p>
The backplate was constrained at the mounting interfaces using remote displacement
boundary conditions to represent attachment to the engine block.
Bearing loads were applied using remote forces and moments aligned with a custom
coordinate system representing the crankshaft axis.

<h2>Solver Limitations & Current Status</h2>

<p>
All geometry preparation, material assignment, meshing, and load application steps were
completed successfully. However, solution execution was temporarily halted due to element type
restrictions in the ANSYS Student license.

<p>
Despite this limitation, the pre-processing workflow demonstrates modeling
decisions, boundary condition definition, and mesh refinement strategies.

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Re-run solution using a licensed commercial solver</li>
  <li>Post-process stress, displacement, and safety factor results</li>
  <li>Perform sensitivity study on fillet radii and fastener spacings</li>
</ul>
