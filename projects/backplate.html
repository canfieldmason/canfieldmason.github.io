<h1>Engine Mount Backplate Structural Analysis</h1>

<p><em>Pre-processing complete; model prepared for solution.</em></p>

<p>
This project focuses on the structural analysis of a small internal combustion engine
mounting backplate used in RC aircraft and marine applications. The objective is to
evaluate stress distribution, deformation behavior, and load transfer paths under
representative operational loading conditions.
</p>

<h2>Geometry Preparation</h2>

<p>
The full engine assembly was first modeled to establish functional context and interface
locations. A reduced geometry containing only the backplate was then extracted for finite
element analysis to improve solution efficiency while preserving all critical load paths,
bearing interfaces, and mounting features.

<h2>Mesh Strategy</h2>

<p>
Mesh refinement was applied selectively to regions of expected stress concentration,
including bearing bores, bolt holes (both through and counterbored), and outer fillet
transitions. A finer element size was used locally to capture stress gradients while
maintaining a reasonable global element count.

<h2>Boundary Conditions & Loading</h2>

<p>
Boundary conditions were applied to represent the backplate being constrained by mounting
fasteners at the crankcase interface. Operational loading was applied at the bearing
locations to simulate axial and radial forces transmitted by the crankshaft, as well as
applied moments consistent with engine operation.

<h2>Solver Limitations & Current Status</h2>

<p>
All geometry preparation, material assignment, meshing, and load application steps were
completed successfully. However, solution execution was halted due to element type
restrictions imposed by the ANSYS Student license.
</p>

<p>
Despite this limitation, the pre-processing workflow demonstrates sound modeling decisions,
appropriate boundary condition definition, and targeted mesh refinement strategies consistent
with industry-standard FEA practice.
</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>
This model is fully prepared for solution under a commercial ANSYS license with little
modification required. Planned next steps include solving for von Mises stress, total
deformation, and reaction forces at the mounting interfaces, followed by evaluation of
factor of safety and identification of potential design improvements.
</p>

<p>
Future extensions of this work may include bolt preload modeling, contact refinement at
bearing interfaces, and comparison against simplified analytical hand calculations. 
Results will be added once solution access is available.
