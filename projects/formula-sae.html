<h1>Formula SAE Chassis Structural Analysis</h1>

<p><em>Completed through ANSYS Innovation Space</em></p>

<p>
This project follows an ANSYS Innovation Space course focused on structural analysis of a
Formula SAE spaceframe chassis. The objective was to develop correct structural modeling,
load case definition, and result interpretation workflows commonly used in motorsport
engineering.
</p>

<p>
The base chassis geometry was provided as a line network. The emphasis of the project was
on proper geometry cleanup, tube property assignment, and evaluation under representative
vehicle load cases rather than original chassis design.
</p>

<h2>Geometry Preparation</h2>

     alt="Formula SAE spaceframe line geometry prepared in SpaceClaim">

<em>
Line-based chassis geometry prepared in SpaceClaim, including cleanup of false intersections
and refinement of node connectivity prior to structural modeling.
</em>

<p>
Tubular cross-sectional properties (outer and inner diameters) were assigned to each frame
member to represent realistic chassis construction before meshing and analysis.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Torsional Stiffness Load Case</h2>

     alt="Formula SAE torsional stiffness test total deformation">

<em>
Torsional stiffness evaluation with equal and opposite vertical forces applied at the
front lower wishbone pickup points.
</em>

<p>
This load case simulates chassis twist during asymmetric wheel loading. Total deformation
was examined to assess torsional compliance and identify highly loaded structural members.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Cornering Load Case</h2>

     alt="Formula SAE cornering load case total deformation">

<em>
Cornering load case with lateral acceleration applied at the center of mass and suspension
pickup points constrained.
</em>

<p>
This analysis represents steady-state cornering conditions, allowing evaluation of global
chassis stiffness and load transfer through the spaceframe.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Aero + Cornering Load Case</h2>

<img src="../images/formula-sae-aero-cornering-deformation.png"
     alt="Formula SAE combined aerodynamic and cornering load case">

<em>
Combined aerodynamic and cornering load case with increased acceleration magnitude.
</em>

<p>
A higher acceleration factor was applied to represent combined aerodynamic downforce and
cornering loads. Results were compared against the baseline cornering case to observe
load scaling and structural sensitivity.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Frontal Impact Load Case</h2>

<img src="../images/formula-sae-frontal-deformation.png"
     alt="Formula SAE frontal impact total deformation">

<em>
Frontal impact simulation with force applied at the front-most nodes and rear supports constrained.
</em>

<img src="../images/formula-sae-frontal-bending.png"
     alt="Formula SAE frontal impact bending moment distribution">

<em>
Resulting bending moment distribution during frontal loading.
</em>

<p>
This load case evaluates the structural response of the front chassis region under impact-like
loading, highlighting load paths and critical members.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Engineering Takeaways</h2>

<p>
This project demonstrates applied use of ANSYS Mechanical for spaceframe chassis modeling,
including line-body structural representation, realistic load case definition, and interpretation
of deformation and internal force results within a Formula SAE context.
</p>

<p>
While the base geometry was provided, the workflow closely mirrors professional motorsport
analysis practices and provides a foundation for future custom chassis design work.
