<h1>Formula SAE Chassis Structural Analysis</h1>

<p><em>ANSYS Innovation Space — Completed Guided Simulation Course</em></p>

<p>
This project focuses on structural analysis of a Formula SAE tubular spaceframe chassis
using ANSYS Mechanical. The objective was to develop correct modeling workflows for
motorsport applications, including geometry preparation, load case definition, and
interpretation of structural response.
</p>

<p>
While the baseline chassis geometry was provided as part of an ANSYS instructional course,
all geometry cleanup, tube property assignment, boundary conditions, and load applications
were completed independently to mirror real-world motorsport analysis practices.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Geometry Preparation</h2>

<p>
The chassis was imported as a line-body network representing the spaceframe centerlines.
False intersections and redundant nodes were removed to ensure proper connectivity prior
to assigning structural properties.
</p>

<p>
Tubular cross-sectional properties, including outer and inner diameters, were assigned to
all members to represent realistic steel tube construction before meshing and analysis.
</p>

<h2>Structural Load Cases</h2>

<h3>Torsional Stiffness</h3>

<p>
Equal and opposite vertical forces were applied at the front lower wishbone pickup points
to evaluate chassis torsional stiffness under asymmetric wheel loading.
</p>

<h3>Cornering</h3>

<p>
A lateral acceleration was applied at the vehicle center of mass while suspension pickup
points were constrained to represent steady-state cornering conditions.

<h3>Aerodynamic + Cornering</h3>

<p>
An increased acceleration magnitude was applied to represent combined aerodynamic
downforce and lateral cornering loads. Results were compared against the baseline
cornering case to observe load scaling effects.

<h3>Frontal Impact</h3>

<p>
A frontal load was applied at the forward-most chassis nodes while rear support locations
were constrained to simulate impact-like loading conditions.

<h2>Results & Engineering Takeaways</h2>

<p>
Across all load cases, the chassis exhibited expected spaceframe behavior with load
transfer concentrated through triangulated members and suspension interfaces.
Regions of increased deformation and internal forces aligned with known motorsport
design sensitivities.
</p>

<p>
This project demonstrates applied use of ANSYS Mechanical for line-body chassis modeling,
realistic motorsport load case definition, and interpretation of deformation and internal
force results within a Formula SAE context.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>
The workflows developed in this guided project form a foundation for future fully custom
chassis designs. These methods will be extended to original vehicle structures,
including Shell Eco-Marathon and student team competition vehicles, with increased focus
on design iteration, manufacturability, and performance optimization.
