<h1>Project Streamline</h1>

<p><em>Small-scale vehicle aerodynamic design, CFD evaluation, and wind tunnel validation</em></p>

<p>
Project Streamline was a team-based engineering design project focused on reducing aerodynamic drag for a small-scale vehicle model. The objective was to develop, analyze, and experimentally validate a body geometry that minimized drag while remaining manufacturable within course constraints.

<strong>Tools & Methods:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>CAD Modeling: Fusion 360 and SOLIDWORKS</li>
  <li>CFD Analysis: SOLIDWORKS Flow Simulation</li>
  <li>Manufacturing: Additive manufacturing (3D printing)</li>
  <li>Experimental Testing: Low-speed wind tunnel measurements</li>
  <li>Design Approach: Iterative trade studies and data-driven refinement</li>

<h2>Design & Analysis Process</h2>

<p>
The project began with development of a parametric baseplate and body geometry suitable for rapid iteration. Multiple aerodynamic profiles were modeled and analyzed using CFD to estimate drag forces and identify trends in performance.
</p>

<p>
Each iteration was evaluated using SOLIDWORKS Flow Simulation, allowing comparison of pressure distributions, wake regions, and predicted drag coefficients before committing to physical fabrication.

<em>Placeholder for pressure distribution or velocity contour results.</em>

<p>
Insights from these simulations guided incremental geometry changes such as nose shaping, taper angle adjustment, and rear-end treatment to promote smoother airflow separation.
</p>

<h2>Fabrication & Experimental Testing</h2>

<p>
The final design iteration was manufactured using additive manufacturing and prepared for wind tunnel testing. The model was mounted to instrumentation that allowed measurement of drag forces under controlled airflow conditions.

<p>
Experimental results were compared to simulation predictions to evaluate accuracy of the CFD model and to determine whether design changes produced measurable performance improvements.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>
Testing demonstrated clear drag trends between design iterations and confirmed that geometric refinements led to improved aerodynamic performance. While small discrepancies existed between simulated and measured values, overall behavior aligned with expectations, reinforcing the importance of pairing computational tools with physical validation.
</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
This project provided hands-on experience with the full aerodynamic design cycle—from concept generation and CAD modeling to CFD analysis, manufacturing, and experimental testing. It highlighted the tradeoffs between simulation fidelity and real-world behavior, as well as the value of structured iteration when optimizing engineering designs.
</p>

<p>
Working within a team environment also strengthened communication and documentation skills, particularly in presenting technical findings and justifying design decisions with data.
