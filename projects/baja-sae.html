<h1>Baja SAE Roll Cage Structural Analysis</h1>

<p><em>ANSYS Innovation Space — Completed Guided Simulation Course</em></p>

<p>
The chassis and roll cage form the primary structural backbone of a Baja SAE vehicle,
supporting drivetrain, suspension, and safety systems while protecting the driver.
This project focuses on finite element analysis of a tubular roll cage to evaluate
structural stiffness, load paths, and stress distributions under representative
competition load cases.
</p>

<p>
While the baseline geometry was provided as part of an ANSYS instructional course,
all geometry preparation, material definition, boundary conditions, and load
applications were completed independently within ANSYS Mechanical.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Geometry Preparation</h2>

<p>
The roll cage geometry was imported as a line body network and cleaned to remove
false intersections and redundant connections. Pipe cross-sectional properties
were assigned to all members to accurately represent the tubular frame structure.

<h2>Structural Load Cases</h2>

<h3>Front Impact</h3>
<p>
A frontal impact load was applied at the forward-most nodes of the roll cage while
rear support locations were constrained to simulate load transfer during a frontal collision.
</p>

<h3>Side Impact</h3>
<p>
Side impact loading was applied laterally to evaluate the roll cage’s ability to
resist intrusion and maintain occupant protection during side collisions.

<h3>Rear Impact</h3>
<p>
Rear impact conditions were simulated by applying longitudinal loads at the rear
of the chassis while constraining the front structure.

<h3>Torsional Loading</h3>
<p>
Opposing vertical forces were applied at the suspension mounting locations to
evaluate torsional stiffness of the roll cage under uneven terrain and dynamic loading.

<h2>Rollover Analysis</h2>

<p>
Rollover loading was applied to simulate vehicle inversion scenarios and assess
stress distribution throughout the primary and secondary structural members.

structural members under simulated rollover conditions.
</em></p>

<hr>

<h2>Results & Interpretation</h2>

<p>
Across all load cases, the roll cage demonstrated effective load redistribution
through triangulated members, with peak stresses occurring near major joints
and suspension interfaces. Deformation patterns aligned with expected structural
behavior for tubular spaceframe designs.
</p>

<p>
These analyses highlight the importance of load path continuity, joint integrity,
and member orientation in achieving stiffness while minimizing unnecessary mass.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>
The workflows developed in this guided project will be applied to future
fully custom chassis designs, specifically Shell Eco-Marathon vehicles.
Future efforts will incorporate manufacturing constraints, joint optimization,
and correlation with physical testing data where available.
