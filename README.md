# Mason Canfield — Mechanical Engineering Portfolio

Mechanical Engineering student at James Madison University (Class of 2027) with interests in
structural analysis, mechanical design, and simulation-driven engineering.

This GitHub serves as a technical portfolio supporting my coursework and extracurricular
engineering projects, with emphasis on finite element analysis and CAD-based design workflows.
