# Mason Canfield — Mechanical Engineering Portfolio

Mechanical Engineering student at James Madison University (Class of 2027) with a focus on
structural analysis, mechanical design, and simulation-driven engineering.

This repository serves as a hub for selected engineering projects, analysis workflows,
and technical documentation supporting my coursework and extracurricular design work.
