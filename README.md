# Mason Canfield — Mechanical Engineering Portfolio

Mechanical Engineering student at James Madison University (Class of 2027) with interests in
structural analysis, mechanical design, and simulation-driven engineering.

This GitHub serves as a technical portfolio supporting my coursework and extracurricular
engineering projects, with emphasis on finite element analysis and CAD-based design workflows.

## Selected Projects

### Engine Mount Backplate — Structural Analysis
- Simplified a small engine assembly to isolate a structurally critical backplate
- Built a solve-ready FEA model with refined meshing at fastener and bearing interfaces
- Documented solver limitations under student licensing while preserving commercial-transferable setup
